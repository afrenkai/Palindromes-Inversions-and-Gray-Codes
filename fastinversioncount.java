// 25 Points) Let A[0..n − 1] be an array of real numbers (or any ordered set). A
// pair (A[i], A[j]) is said to be an inversion if these numbers (elements) are out
// of order, i.e., i < j but A[i] > A[j]. Note that this pair need not be adjacent.
// The array/sequence (3, 2, 1) contains three inversions: (3,2), (2,1), and (3,1).
// Include a mechanism to allow users to enter a list of numbers from the console
// (keyboard) — either 8 by default or a choice of length entered by the user.
// (10 Points) Write a program with a na ̈ıve O(n2) [sorting] algorithm that counts
// the number of inversions in such an array A.
// Call your program/project ‘easyinversioncount’.
// (15 Points) Write a program with a O(n log n) [sorting] algorithm that counts
// the number of inversions in such an array A.
// Call your program/project ‘fastinversioncount’.
